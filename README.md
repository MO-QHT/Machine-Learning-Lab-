# Machine-Learning-Lab

**Name:** Mohammed Alqahtani  
**Course:** Machine Learning Lab  

This repository contains my **Machine Learning laboratory work**, completed as part of my university coursework.  
The labs focus on understanding core machine learning concepts, data handling techniques, model development processes, and performance evaluation methods through hands-on practice.

Each lab is organized into its own folder and demonstrates practical implementation of machine learning concepts using real datasets and structured methodologies.

The repository is intended for **educational and academic purposes**.
