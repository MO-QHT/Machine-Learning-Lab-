## Part 1: Choosing an Open Dataset

An open dataset titled **KFC Global Sales Dataset (2018–2024)** was selected for this lab.

The dataset contains structured business data including yearly and monthly sales performance across multiple countries and branches.
It includes both numerical and categorical variables, making it suitable for machine learning analysis.

## Part 2: Defining the Machine Learning Problem

This project addresses a machine learning problem using the **KFC Global Sales Dataset**.
The goal is to analyze sales-related features and understand how factors such as marketing spend, customer count, country, and branch performance influence overall sales outcomes.

### Problem Type:
Regression Problem

### Target Variable:
Sales

### Model Objective:
The objective of the model is to learn patterns from historical sales data and predict future sales performance based on input features such as marketing spend, customer count, and branch location.


By understanding these relationships, the model can help evaluate the effectiveness of marketing strategies and business performance across different regions.

## Part 3: Loading and Inspecting the Dataset in Python

The KFC Global Sales dataset was loaded and inspected using Python and the Pandas library.
The dataset file was uploaded to the repository and then read in a Jupyter Notebook. Initial inspection included checking the dataset structure, previewing sample rows, and verifying column names and data types.

## Part 4: Designing the Methodology Diagram

A methodology diagram was created and uploaded to the repository to visually represent the complete machine learning workflow used in this lab.  
The diagram illustrates dataset selection, data loading, data preprocessing, train/test split, model training, model evaluation, and results.
