## Part 1: Choosing an Open Dataset

An open dataset titled **Chocolate Sales** was selected for this lab.  
The dataset contains structured sales data, making it suitable for machine learning analysis.

**Dataset Source:**

## Part 2: Defining the Machine Learning Problem

This project addresses a machine learning problem using the Chocolate Sales dataset.  
The goal is to analyze sales-related features and use them to classify sales records into meaningful categories, helping to better understand sales performance patterns.

- **Problem Type:** Classification problem  
- **Target Variable:** The dataset includes a target variable used to classify sales records into predefined categories  
- **Model Objective:** The model learns patterns from the sales data and predicts the correct class for each record based on its features

## Part 3: Loading and Inspecting the Dataset in Python

The Chocolate Sales dataset was loaded and inspected using Python and the Pandas library.  
The dataset file was uploaded to the repository and then read in a Jupyter Notebook. Initial inspection included checking the dataset structure, previewing sample rows, and verifying column names and data types.

## Part 4: Designing the Methodology Diagram

A methodology diagram was created and uploaded to the repository to visually represent the complete machine learning workflow used in this lab.  
The diagram illustrates dataset selection, data loading, data preprocessing, train/test split, model training, model evaluation, and results.
