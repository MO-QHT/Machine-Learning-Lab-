# Machine Learning Lab – Dataset Exploration & Methodology

This lab applies the fundamental steps of a machine learning workflow, starting from dataset selection and ending with the design of a complete methodology diagram.

## Part 1: Choosing an Open Dataset

An open dataset titled **Chocolate Sales** was selected for this lab.  
The dataset contains structured sales data, making it suitable for machine learning analysis.

---

## Part 2: Defining the Machine Learning Problem

The machine learning problem is defined as a **classification task**.  
The dataset includes a target variable that allows sales records to be categorized based on features such as product, country, sales person, and sales values.

The model is expected to learn patterns from the data and **predict the correct class for each record**.

## Part 3: Loading and Inspecting the Dataset in Python

The dataset was loaded and inspected using **Python and Pandas**.  
Initial inspection included viewing the dataset structure, checking column names, and verifying data types.

## Part 4: Designing the Methodology Diagram

A methodology diagram was designed to represent the complete machine learning workflow.  
The diagram includes dataset selection, data loading, preprocessing, train/test split, model training, model evaluation, and results.
