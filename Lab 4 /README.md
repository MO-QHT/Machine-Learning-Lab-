In this lab, I completed the Data Quality Assessment & Preprocessing steps using the KFC Sales dataset. I implemented data inspection, missing value checks, duplicate detection.

However, after reviewing my work, I realized that some parts of the implementation were not structured correctly and did not fully follow best practices. Therefore, I decided to redo the entire lab to ensure the preprocessing steps are properly organized, correctly applied, and clearly documented.
