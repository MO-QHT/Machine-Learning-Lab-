## Part 1: Choosing an Open Dataset

An open dataset titled **Screen Time, Sleep & Stress Analysis** was selected for this lab.

The dataset contains 50,000 structured user records analyzing:
- Smartphone usage behavior  
- Sleep patterns  
- Stress levels  
- Workplace productivity indicators

## Part 2: Defining the Machine Learning Problem

This project addresses a machine learning problem using the Screen Time, Sleep & Stress dataset. The dataset provides structured behavioral and demographic information related to smartphone usage, sleep duration, stress levels, and workplace productivity indicators.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze how lifestyle and smartphone usage patterns influence an individual’s stress level. By examining relationships between features such as daily screen time, sleep duration, device type, occupation, and age, the model aims to identify patterns that contribute to increased or decreased stress levels.


### Problem Type:
Regression

### Target Variable:
Stress Level


The model will learn patterns from behavioral and usage features and estimate stress scores for unseen data.

## Part 3: Loading and Inspecting the Dataset in Python

A Jupyter Notebook was created to load and inspect the Screen Time, Sleep & Stress dataset using Python and the Pandas library.

The dataset file was uploaded to the repository and read into the notebook for initial inspection.

A methodology diagram was created and uploaded to the repository to visually represent the complete machine learning workflow used in this lab.  
The diagram illustrates dataset selection, data loading, data preprocessing, train/test split, model training, model evaluation, and results.
