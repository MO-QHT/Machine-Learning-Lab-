# Lab 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

In this lab, I applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to understand the dataset before building any machine learning models. EDA is a critical step in the ML workflow because it allows us to explore data structure, detect issues, identify patterns, and understand relationships between variables.

## Dataset Used

For this lab, I used the **KFC Past Sales Dataset**.

The dataset contains historical sales data including:

- Year  
- Month  
- Country  
- Branch ID  
- Sales  
- Customers  
- Marketing Spend  

This structured tabular dataset is suitable for performing statistical analysis and visualization.

## Why I Switched to the KFC Dataset

Initially, I was working with a different dataset. However, I decided to switch to the KFC dataset for the following reasons:

- The KFC dataset is fully structured and clean.
- It contains clear numerical and categorical features.
- It is well-suited for performing distribution analysis, grouping, and correlation analysis.
- It allows better demonstration of EDA techniques such as:
  - Histograms
  - Scatter plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - rouped aggregations
  - Time-based analysis

The structure of the KFC dataset makes it easier to clearly explain patterns and relationships, which aligns well with the objectives of Lab 3.

This lab helped me understand how to explore and interpret structured business data before applying machine learning models. Performing EDA ensures better feature selection, improved model performance, and stronger data-driven decision-making.

EDA is a foundational step in the machine learning lifecycle, and this lab strengthened my ability to analyze real-world datasets effectively.
